# athome-japan-agent-harness

A conversational CLI agent that finds homes to rent or buy on athome.co.jp from
natural language. You describe what you want; the agent translates it into AtHome
filters, harvests matching listings, shortlists with an LLM, scrapes details, and
returns a ranked, reasoned shortlist with direct links.

## Project status
